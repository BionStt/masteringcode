# Mastering Code
NPM

> >Author Notes:
- If you are a modern developer looking for a job, you have to understand one key piece of tooling software and that's NPM...the node package manager. It's part of nodejs, but it's it's sort of it's own separate component. Let's take a look.

## NPM Basics

</ul>

1. Let's talk about the basics. NPM allows you to create or use a variety of packages available to developers on the web. The main website where you can find these packages is [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

2. You can find tons of reusable code including frameworks and libraries like angularjs, react and bootstrap and easily install them through the terminal. When you go to the site, you can do a search for a module and get more information about how to install that module. You'll also get a link to the repository for that module.

3. In order to use NPM, you need to install NodeJS. You can do that through this [website](https://nodejs.org/en/). Once you install NodeJS, you'll have NPM installed.

4. To work with NPM, you can use a terminal. In windows, it will be easier if you install or have a terminal which allows you to use the unix file system. Most of the examples that you'll find online, use linux type commands. One terminal that's easy to install and use is the terminal that comes when you install git, which you can [find here]( https://git-scm.com/). As you go through the installation, make sure that you also install Gitbash if you're using a PC. On a mac, you can use the terminal application.

One note: If you've been following along with this course, we've been using the practice environments to work through most of these examples. For this week, I'm not going to do that, I'll just use the terminal to show you how NPM works.

There's a lot to NPM, but some important commands are npm init, which asks a few questions to create a special file NPM uses called the package.json file.
