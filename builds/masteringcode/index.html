            “During the summer, our rabbit, Tonto, began to have severe redness and itching on his belly and feet. Through diagnostic testing, we learned that Tonto is severely allergic to over a dozens kinds of grass pollens. We've now been doing allergy injections for several months, and his itching and redness have nearly gone away. I'm very thankful to the veterinarians and staff at Wisdom for the excellent care Tonto received, and for nipping his allergies in the bud, so to speak.”

            “When Samantha, our Siamese cat, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop confirmed what we all feared - Samantha was showing signs of diabetes. The doctor put us on a daily routine to provide Samantha insulin injections, and showed us how to administer the shots. We weren't sure we could do it, but the gang at Wisdom was very supportive and encouraging. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal. Thank you, Wisdom Pet Medicine!

            “The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Golden Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normally, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly. The vet noted our address on Roxie's chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was "of course – she's a Retriever." That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.
