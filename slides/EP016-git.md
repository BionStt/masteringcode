# Mastering Code
Version control

> >Author Notes:
- Version control allows you to manage changes to projects by saving the state of code at different times. By far, the most popular version control language is git with roughly 70% of professional developers saying they use it over other technologies. If you're going to a apply for a job in tech, you need to be comfortable with how it works.

1. You can think of version control as something like a time machine that lets you go to pre-defined points in time. You create save these points in time a commits that will let you come back and revisit those points in the future.

1. Git also allows you to create branches, they're similar to commits but you can create these to do bigger experiments with code. Commits are linear progressions in your code. When you want to really change big parts of the code, you can do a branch.

1. One of the things that makes Git really popular is that it's a distributed version control system. The difference is that different people can check out the same code to different machines and they can work on the code separately. So one person can be working on the CSS and another on a javascript feature and then they can get together and merge those changes back into the application.

1. So the traditional process for working with git is to make changes to your code and start by staging those changes. Staging is a temporary placeholder for your code. Once you're happy with your code, you commit that and that stores a point in time you can come back to. If you want to work on a new feature, you can use branches and then use the merge command to bring those changes to another branch.

1. If you've got a few minutes, and you've never used git, let's practice the basics. You're going to need to have installed two things. First, you'll need to install Git, which you can find at [this URL](https://git-scm.com), then you'll need NodeJS, which you can [find here](https://nodejs.org/en). To make things quick, I've prepared a zip file with some code that you can download at [this URL]().
