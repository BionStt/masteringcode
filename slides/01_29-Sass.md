# Mastering Code
Sass

> > Author Notes:

- If you're applying for a job, it's really important that you know how to work with CSS pre-processors because you'll probably be asked about them during interviews. It's a better way to write CSS, but more importantly it will make you more marketable, so let's take a peek at what Sass is, why you need it and then look at an example of converting css to Sass.

## Sass

<ul>
  <li class="fragment">`.scss` vs. `.sass`</li>
  <li class="fragment">Ruby vs. Node-sass</li>
  <li class="fragment">Variables, nesting, partials, mixins</li>
</ul>

Sass stands for syntactically Awesome Stylesheets, but more importantly it's a way of writing CSS that is similar to CSS, but gives you some additional capabilities. Here's some of the essential things you need to know about the language.

1. First there are two versions and therefore two file extensions scss is the newer version that is more popular and looks almost exactly like regular CSS with some additional features, which is a great way to learn. As a matter of fact, you can use perfectly normal css in an scss file. The .sass file extension requires you to use an older sytanx where spaces and indentation is relevant. If you're getting started. scss is the better way to go.

2. Since it is a processed language, your browser doesn't understand those files without translation. There are two main ways of translating sass. You can use Ruby, which is the original language and a lot harder to install, or you can use Node-sass, which is a nodejs package. Node-sass is faster at processing, so it's the better way to go, although it always lags a bit behind ruby in terms of development.

3. The main features that sass gives you are variables, nesting, partials and mixins, which are like functions. You should know that a lot of these features are becoming available in newer versions of CSS. Let's take a look at how we can use these to improve the way we write CSS.
