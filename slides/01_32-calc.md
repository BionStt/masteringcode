# Mastering Code
calc()

> > Author Notes:

- Calc is a CSS feature that lets you perform mathematical calculations right in your CSS. It can be really useful when writing layout CSS because it can make things clearer.

## CSS Calc

- Good Support
- Combine units
- Whitespace sensitive
- Nestable

> > Author Notes:

- Calc has pretty good support in modern browsers, even down to internet explorer 9.
- One of the cool features of calc is that you can mix and match units so you can ask for a percentage unit, but substract a pixel size from the unit.
- One thing you do have to watch out for is that the plus and minus operators must be surrounded by whitespace, so you do have to be careful. A good linter might help with this.
- You can easily nest calculations inside other calculations or use CSS variables to make things easier.
